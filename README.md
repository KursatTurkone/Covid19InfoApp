# Covid19InfoApp
You need to copy and paste https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/xml/ this URL to work with the project. It could be automatic
but my doctor lecturer said it must be like this. But you can feel free to use these code or code parts. 
The project has shortcomings like i couldn't manage to add an alert with an exception and the tables visualize from present to past. It should be opposite.
